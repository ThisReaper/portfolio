            <h2>I try to work with brands and businesses from all around the world to create high quality design and engaging experiences.</h2>
            <p>During my school days, I was particularly interested in technical subjects such as computer science and engineering and constantly tried to develop skills in these areas. After the 9th grade I began my studies at Accounting Business College in Zambia. </p>
            <p>During my training, I was able to acquire IT knowledge, I learned how computer networks work, how network security is ensured and how to address software and hardware problems.</p>
            <p>I completed my school training in English and since the beginning of 2022 I have acquired the German language in B1 and B2 language courses</p>
            <p>Now I want to learn a profession in which I can realize my abilities even further. Due to my quick comprehension and high willingness to learn, I am able to familiarize myself with new areas of activity and after a short time to work independently.</p>
